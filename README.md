### Things I've done:
<!-- - 💬 Used `RegEx` to write an algorithm that, once selected from the webpage of `quizlet/wrts`, converts text into an `a=b format`, so I can use them. ([QuizletToWozzol](../../../QuizletToWozzol)) -->

- 🔢 Written an $n > 2^{64}$ `Vec<u8>`-based integer datatype in `Rust` ([Bignums](../../../bignums))

- 🔎 Wrote a program that tracks players, using their `API` and timed `GET` requests, on `Hypixel`, a popular minecraft server. ([Hytracker2](../../../HyTracker2))

- 🖼️ Made a custom `image file format`, that stores `pixel data` using the closest `CSS3` name. ([SIGMA-format](../../../SIGMA-format))
