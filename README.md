# Hello! I'm BBernYY!
I'm a kid who is into programming!
Yea... That's probably the best way to describe myself-
I live in The Netherlands and am currently in my second year of high school! (2/6)
I can use Python, and I'm trying to learn C# and JS.
When I get the motivation to do so...
Make sure to take a look at some of my projects!
If you want to contact me, My discord is @BBernYY#7455!
